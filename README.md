# Prior-Path-Selection
Formal analysis techniques can detect security vulnerabilities in security protocols, but when analyzing complex security protocols, the state space explosion problem often prevents the analysis from terminating. The fundamental cause of this is-sue is the exponential increase in the number of protocol states due to an excessive number of redundant nodes. To address this, the Prior Path Selection method was proposed, which used the nodes of already searched paths to guide the selection of subsequent nodes, reducing the number of protocol states and effectively circumventing the state space explosion, thus im-proving efficiency. By utilizing the Oracle interface of the Tamarin prover model checking tool, this method was applied to the analysis of security protocols, and comparative experiments were conducted on 5 protocols with 8 lemmas. The experi-mental results show that the Prior Path Selection method successfully provides analysis results for protocols where conven-tional path search is ineffective, mitigating the state space explosion problem.
